# password-generator

The purpose of this product is to use javascript to create a password generator. This app runs in the browser and does not need any setup for it to function as it is a live, deployed link. Once the website is loaded, the user is presented with a simple rectangular UI with a button for interaction. Upon pressing the button, the user is prompted with a series of prompts to address the criteria for the password that will be generated. 

The first pop-up is a prompt asking the user for a numerical input between 8 and 128 and shows an error otherwise. The next four confirm messages are to decide whether the user wants lowercase, uppercase, numerical, and/or special characters. There is an error message for when none of the options are chosen. The password is generated once the popups are correctly addressed.
